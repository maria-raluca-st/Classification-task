Task

Build a robust company classifier for a new insurance taxonomy.
Objectives

    Accept a list of companies with associated data:
    – Company Description
    – Business Tags
    – Sector, Category, Niche Classification
    Receive a static taxonomy (a list of labels) relevant to the insurance industry.
    Build a solution that accurately classifies these companies, and any similar ones, into one or more labels from the static taxonomy.
    Present your results and demonstrate effectiveness.

Guidelines

Since this is an unsolved problem without a predefined ground truth, you’ll need to validate your classifier’s performance through your own methods.

    Analyze strengths and weaknesses:
        Explain where your solution excels and where it may need improvement.
        Discuss scalability and how your solution performs with large datasets.
        Reflect on any assumptions made and unknown factors that could impact your solution.
    Critical Thinking – asking yourself challenging questions about your approach and results is the best thing you can do:
        Where does my solution work great? Where does it struggle and need more improvement?
        Have I tested the long tail? If it works poorly there, what’s my plan? Does the current approach allow for future improvements?
        What do I know I don’t know about the solution?
        How well can it run on huge amounts of data?
        What trade-offs did I make between accuracy and computational efficiency?
        What did I learn during this project that I didn’t know before?
        What should I learn to be even better at this?
        And many more…
    Provide insights into your problem-solving process:
        Why you did what you did, what other paths you considered, and especially why you chose not to pursue them.
    At Veridion, we run similar algorithms on billions of records. While your solution doesn’t need to scale to that level, it would be impressive if it does. For now, however, what matters most is your approach to solving the problem—if your solution is exceptional for the given dataset, we trust that you can scale it effectively using the right tools.
